Hello, these are my Linux dotfiles. I have been using Linux as a daily driver for about 3 years now... I am currently using Arch but might move to Artix in the future. You can find my dotfiles on [Github](https://github.com/m4dr1nch/Dots), enjoy **(◕‿◕✿)**.

Software that I use:
* OS - **Arch (btw)**
* Window manager - **I3VM**
* Terminal emulator - **Alacritty**
* Notification daemon - **Dunst**
* Application launcher - **Rofi**
* Text editor - **Neovim**
* File manager - **Ranger**
* Terminal multiplexer - **Tmux**
* System shell - **ZSH**

**The final desktop should look something like this:**
